## General Information
The creation of a CNN-based melanoma detection model. If melanoma is not found in its early stages, it can be fatal. 
It is responsible for 75% of skin cancer fatalities. A system that can analyse photos and notify doctors of the existence of melanoma might 
potentially eliminate the need for a lot of manual diagnosis work.

The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) created the collection, which comprises of 2357 photographs of both 
malignant and benign oncological illnesses. With the exception of melanomas and moles, whose photos have a minor predominance, 
all images were sorted according to the categorization determined with ISIC, and all subgroups were divided into the same number of images.

## Technologies Used
- Python3
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Keras
- Tensor Flow
- Augmentor

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
- Using the Augmentor library has improved training data accuracy
- Model is overfitting.
- The overfitting issue can be resolved by adding additional layers, neurons, or dropout layers.
- The hyperparameter can be adjusted to further enhance the model.
